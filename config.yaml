      Whether to use a multipath connection for iSCSI or FC in Cinder

    description: |
      SAN protocol to use. Choose between iscsi or fc.
  volume-backend-name:
    type: string
    description: |
        Volume backend name for the backend. The default value is the
        application name in the Juju model, e.g. "cinder-mybackend"
        if it's deployed as `juju deploy cinder-infinidat cinder-mybackend`.
        A common backend name can be set to multiple backends with the
        same characters so that those can be treated as a single virtual
        backend associated with a single volume type.
